DLD, "Database for Damage and Loss Fragilities and Consequence Functions: Loss computations use fragility and consequence functions for modern and archaic structural and nonstructural components and assem- blies in structures. The database of such functions for components and assemblies is small and must be expanded through coordinated numerical and experimental simulations", GC , M,
