    "Description": "Structural, Steel Moment Frame, Low-Rise, High-Code",
    "Comments": "Structural components represent the structural system in the building.\nStructural System: These buildings have a frame of steel columns and beams. In some cases, the beam-column connections have very small moment resisting capacity but, in other cases, some of the beams and columns are fully developed as moment frames to resist lateral forces. Usually, the structure is concealed on the outside by exterior nonstructural walls, which can be of almost any material (curtain walls, brick masonry, or precast concrete panels), and on the inside by ceilings and column furring. Diaphragms transfer lateral loads to moment-resisting frames. The diaphragms can be almost any material. The frames develop their stiffness by full or partial moment connections. The frames can be located almost anywhere in the building. Usually, the columns have their strong directions oriented so that some columns act primarily in one direction while the others act in the other direction. Steel moment frame buildings are typically more flexible than shear wall buildings.

The roof and walls consist of lightweight panels, usually corrugated metal. The frames are designed for maximum efficiency, often with tapered beam and column sections built up of light steel plates. The frames are built in segments and assembled in the field with bolted joints. Lateral loads in the transverse direction are resisted by the rigid frames with loads distributed to them by diaphragm elements, typically rod- braced steel roof framing bays. Tension rod bracing typically resists loads in the longitudinal direction.\nThese structures are mostly single-story structures combining rod-braced frames in one direction and moment frames in the other. Due to repetitive nature of the structural systems, the type of damage to structural members is expected to be rather uniform throughout the structure.\nDesign Level: Approximate Basis: UBC Seismic Zone 0, NEHRP Map Area 1.\nPre-1941 construction in all other UBC and NEHRP areas.\nPre-Code damage functions are appropriate for modeling older buildings that were not designed for earthquake load, regardless of where they are located in the United States.",
